# NAICS to STIX 2.1 Converter for OpenCTI

This script converts [NAICS](https://www.census.gov/naics/) (North American Industry Classification System) sector data into [STIX 2.1](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) format, making it compatible for ingestion into [OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/), the open-source threat intelligence platform.

## ðŸ“‚ Source Data

NAICS codes were sourced from the official 2022 list available here:

> [2022 NAICS Codes - 2-Digit through 6-Digit (Excel)](https://www-naics-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/www.naics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-NAICS-Codes-listed-numerically-2-Digit-through-6-Digit.xlsx)

## ðŸ“˜ What is NAICS?

NAICS is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments. It provides a consistent framework for analyzing and comparing economic activity across various sectors and subsectors in North America.

NAICS codes are hierarchical:
- **2-digit codes** represent broad economic sectors.
- **3-digit codes** represent subsectors.
- **4- to 6-digit codes** offer increasingly specific industry definitions.

For example:
- `52` = Finance and Insurance (broad sector)
- `524` = Insurance Carriers and Related Activities (subsector)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Convert NAICS to STIX?

By integrating NAICS data into STIX 2.1, threat intelligence platforms like OpenCTI can benefit from structured and standardized industry classification, enabling:
- Better **sector attribution** in threat reports.
- Enhanced **analytical granularity**, allowing users to correlate threat actor activity or malware campaigns with specific economic sectors or industries.
- Improved **data enrichment** capabilities when combining threat intelligence with sector-specific risk analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Benefits of Using 2- and 3-digit NAICS Codes

While full 6-digit NAICS codes offer precision, the **2- and 3-digit levels** are often more practical for cybersecurity applications:
- They strike a balance between **detail and generalization** â€” ideal for threat modeling without overfitting data.
- They help **normalize sector references** in OpenCTI across different data sources.
- Many threat actors are reported to target sectors at the 2- or 3-digit level (e.g., `51` - Information, `62` - Healthcare and Social Assistance), making this granularity particularly useful.

## ðŸ§¾ Sample Output

The script outputs a STIX 2.1 bundle containing `Identity` objects with detailed sector information. Below is a truncated example:
